        <p class=" d-none  d-sm-block">At Fingerprint Marketing, our website designers have a serious knack for turning the blah into head-turning, trusted brands and online presences that dominate their markets.According to the guys at Microsoft, we have a shorter attention span than goldfish (those little guys have 9 seconds)! What does your website design say in 8 seconds? How does it make someone feel in 8 seconds? I know, I know - you can’t even grab a Starbucks in 8 seconds, but these are the hard facts. You have to take your web presence seriously. Luckily, we already do.</p>
